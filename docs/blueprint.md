## Core Features:

- Clock Minting: Allows users to mint Time NFTs with selectable durations and themes; stores start and end times on-chain.
- Countdown and Rarity: Dynamically updates NFT rarity tiers (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary) based on remaining time, reflected in animated rings and rarity glows.
- Automatic Evolution: Evolves the NFT's metadata and artwork upon timer expiry, triggering a change to its 'Final Form'.
- Dynamic Metadata and SVG: Generates SVG images and JSON metadata for NFTs, including animated rings, countdown arc, and rarity-based visual effects.
- Wallet Connection: Integrates Wagmi/Viem to enable wallet connection for minting and managing clocks.

- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to highlight interactive elements and pulsing countdowns.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font with a computerized feel, for both headlines and body text. 
- Use minimalist icons for navigation, employing neon color accents to maintain the futuristic aesthetic.
- Implement a grid layout for the marketplace and user dashboards, with glassmorphism effects for depth.
- Use smooth micro-animations for countdown timers, pulsing glows, and subtle particle sparks as expiration approaches.
