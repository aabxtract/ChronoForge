ChronoForge — Forge Your Time NFTs

ChronoForge is a futuristic, time-driven NFT platform where users mint dynamic countdown NFTs called Clocks.
As time passes, each Clock becomes rarer, changes appearance, and eventually evolves into a unique final form when its countdown reaches zero.

This project merges on-chain logic, dynamic metadata, and cinematic UI design to create a new kind of Web3 experience:
Time is your forge. Your NFT evolves as time flows.

🌌 Features
🕰️ Dynamic Time NFTs

Each Clock NFT has:

Start timestamp

End timestamp

Theme (cyberpunk, astral, molten, minimal)

Dynamic rarity tier based on remaining time

All traits update automatically as time progresses.

✨ Real-Time Evolution

NFTs evolve through time-based rarity tiers:

Time Left	Rarity	Visual Style
75–100%	Common	dim ring
40–75%	Uncommon	soft glow
20–40%	Rare	neon pulse
5–20%	Epic	animated intense glow
0–5%	Legendary	bright, pulsating aura
0%	Final Form	unique permanent artwork

At expiry, the NFT transitions into a final, unlocked form.
